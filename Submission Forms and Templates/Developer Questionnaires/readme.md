Instructions for editing / updating template versions:
1. Insert a new row at the top of the Revision History tab that denotes the new revision number (next integer value), the date, author, and changes.
2. Update the file properties (File > Properties > Summary) with the current template version so that a recipient of the file will know which version of the template was used even if the revision history tab is deleted.
