This folder contains all the lab templates for test results and certification submissions.

Instructions for editing / updating template versions:
1. Insert a new row at the top of the Revision History section that denotes the new revision number (next integer value), the date, author, and changes.
2. Update the document footer with the current template version so that a recipient of the file will know which version of the template was used even if the revision history section is deleted.
